"""
Query variables demo application.

This is intended for newcomers to Python and/or GraphQL to see in one place
what the minimum components are to do a request and print the response, using
variables. This is just meant as a demo though, as it is too simple to be
resuable or robust.

See also the basic demo script in the same directory.

This script makes use of variables which are sent in the JSON payload. The
variables are already setup so no arguments are needed for this script. In
the GQL explorer, the variables data would go in the Query Variables pane.

    According to that SO post, query variables must be sent in on the JSON
    payload with the 'variables' key.
    request.post(..., json={'query': query, 'variables': variables}, ...)
